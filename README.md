# Reducing-Customer-Churn---Group-Data-Science-Competition

#This was a 4-day challenge where with a dataset containing information on 170,800 mobile phone customers
#The objective was to analyze the data and present business recommendations
#We analyzed it from a few perspectives: customer churn, RFM analysis, customer segmentation, Lift/Accuracy computations, and more.

#An action plan was created based on the data. For example, most customers churn within the first 2 months (likely in part because they may only be visiting) but additional attention should be geared towards a client's first experience.

#Additionally, we touched on other key considerations such as an improved online sales channel, cybersecurity implementation, and tailored promotions to churned customers.
